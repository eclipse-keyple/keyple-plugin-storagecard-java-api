<p>This document provides the API specification for the development of <b>Keyple Storage Card APDU interpreters</b>.</p>

<p>This API standardizes communication with storage-type smart cards, providing abstraction layers for APDU processing
    and memory-based operations.</p>

<p>The purpose of this API is to provide an APDU interpreter factory designed to be supplied to plugins capable of
    handling storage-type smart card processing functionalities. It enables the creation of specific APDU interpreter
    instances tailored to process APDU commands and manage interactions with storage-type smart cards.</p>

<p>The internal package contains:</p>
<ul>
    <li>APIs that must be implemented by the plugins to facilitate storage card communication within the Keyple
        ecosystem.
    </li>
    <li>SPIs that must be implemented by the APDU interpretation library to translate high-level commands into
        specific storage card operations.
    </li>
</ul>
